# Coming Soon

We have some exciting new features planned:

**Summary view** - Will summarize the user input and allow a quick edit functionality.

**Progress indicator** - This will visually indicate to the user the progress through the form.

**Conditions** - An additional configurable item which will allow for dynamic form generation, based on the answers given, new inputs can be added to the sequence.

**Custom Components** - We also plan to make some out-of-the-box custom components, like a date selector.

If you have any ideas for the project, or would like to contribute, [let us know](https://github.com/Anivive/vue3-form-wizard/issues).
